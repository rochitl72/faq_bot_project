## 1. Installation & Setup  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.  

### Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/faq-chatbot.git
cd faq-chatbot

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Running the Chatbot

Option 1: Terminal Chatbot

You can run the chatbot in a command-line interface.

python src/chatbot.py

Example Usage:

FAQ Chatbot: Ask me anything! Type 'exit' to quit.

You: What is the company’s refund policy?
Bot: Our refund policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase.

You: exit
Goodbye!


---

Option 2: Flask API Server

Run the chatbot as a web API:

python app.py

This runs the API at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Testing the API

Use a browser or Postman to test the API by sending a GET request:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask?query=How can I contact support?

Example API Response:

{
  "answer": "You can contact customer support at support@example.com."
}

4. How to Add More FAQs

You can add more questions and answers by editing data/faq.csv.

CSV Format

question,answer
"What is the company’s refund policy?","Our refund policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase."
"How can I contact customer support?","You can contact customer support at support@example.com."
"Where are your offices located?","Our offices are located in New York, London, and Tokyo."

After Updating the Dataset

Simply restart the chatbot (python src/chatbot.py) or the API (python app.py) to index the new data.

5. How It Works (Technical Overview)

1. Data Preprocessing:

Reads faq.csv and converts text to lowercase.

Removes special characters and unwanted symbols.



2. Answer Retrieval (TF-IDF Matching):

Converts questions into TF-IDF vectors.

Uses cosine similarity to find the best-matching answer.

If similarity is below a threshold, returns a fallback message.



3. Flask API:

Serves a /ask endpoint for queries.

Returns JSON responses with the best-matching answer.

6. Dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Install them using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Contents of requirements.txt:

flask
pandas
scikit-learn

7. Future Improvements

✅ Integrate OpenAI embeddings for better retrieval.
✅ Add support for multilingual queries (via translation APIs).
✅ Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for dynamic responses.
✅ Allow document uploads to auto-build an FAQ from manuals.

8. Troubleshooting & FAQs

1. Flask API not working?

Ensure Flask is installed:

pip install flask

Restart the API:

python app.py

Check if another process is using port 5000. If so, change the port:

python app.py --port 5001


2. Getting incorrect answers?

Ensure your faq.csv is well-formatted.

Increase dataset size for better retrieval.

Modify similarity threshold in retriever.py to fine-tune accuracy.
